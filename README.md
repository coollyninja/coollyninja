LLM tooling for hacking out code

## Status

This project is in its infancy and currently exists as a swath of Jupyter
notebooks strewn about between all of my projects, environments, and
machines.  In the name of progress, all of this information will be
assembled into one curated collection of notebooks and tooling to use LLMs
for the sake of inferring better resolutions around software development.

As things evolve, this project will incorporate them, using new facades,
libraries, and applications as they may fit for use in tooling around
software development.

Enjoy!

## How does it work?

Right now, it's just a collection of Jupyter notebooks.  Peruse them, copy
and incorporate them, just keep in mind the license attached to the
project.
